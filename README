PHP Runtime AOP Framework Readme

Notice:
Code and API are highly experimental and might change, mainly intended  for experimentation and educational use.
Will update comments, and API details later on, at the moment clean commit

Overview:

The design supports matching of cross-cutting segments using a Join-Point model similar to Aspect-Oriented Programming, binding additional code to be run using delegation and weaving of the aspects at run-time mainly through publish-subscribe methodology.

The Framework provides base classes and certain implemented classes which should be sufficient for basic usage.

For a detailed explanation of the inner-workings of the framework refer to doc.pdf
